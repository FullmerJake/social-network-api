  ## Installation
  Make sure that you've downloaded the repository from github and have all of the depencancies installed. While you're at it, make sure that you have MongoDB on whatever machine you're using and that it is running. Enter npm start to boot up the server. Once you've done that, use Insomnia Core to run your API requests and test the functionality.

  ## Usage
  The main usage is to connect this backend to whatever social media frontend you've created. Study the included API routes, connect them to front end functionality and wah-la! You've got yourself a basic social media application.

  ## Contribution
  The most obvious contribution that can be made is so built a frontend. Once that has been done, adding more functionality and connections between the documents would make for a more in-depth application. As it stands, this is a very simple application.
